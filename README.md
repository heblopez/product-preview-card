## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

This project helped me to reinforce the use of Tailwind CSS, as it is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and styling of components.

```tsx
  <article className='bg-white rounded-lg overflow-hidden max-w-[425px] mx-auto md:max-w-[600px] md:flex md:items-stretch md:justify-center md:gap-4'>
    <figure className='md:self-stretch md:w-1/2'>...</figure>
    <div className='p-6 gap-2 flex flex-col md:w-1/2 md:self-center'>
      <p className='text-xs uppercase tracking-[0.25rem] mb-1'>Perfume</p>
      <h1>...</h1>
      <p>...</p>
      <div className='flex items-center my-2 justify-start gap-5'>
        <p>...</p>
        <p className='text-paragraph line-through text-xs'>$169.99</p>
      </div>
      <button className='bg-primary text-white rounded-md p-3 flex gap-3 items-center justify-center'>
        <img src={iconCart} alt="Cart icon" />
        <p className='font-bold'>Add to Cart</p>
      </button>
    </div>
  </article>
```

### Continued development

Working on this project made me realize the importance of using Tailwind CSS to style components, as it is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development and styling of components.
